/Glox/ is a CraftOS Graphical Shell and series of libraries for ComputerCraft that enables a richer UX. It is formerly known as agui-shell with it's dependencies and newer stuff ripped out of my personal repo into a repo of it's own.

You can install glox with: 
	> ac-get run-manifest https://raw.github.com/AmandaCameron/cc-glox/master/install.manifest

Glox consists of the following components:
	* deun -- Top-level multi-tasking system for ComputerCraft, allowing background services, and is the launch vehicle for glox.
	* highbeam -- OS X Spotlight-like thing implemented for ComputerCraft.
	* glox -- The graphical shell itself.

The Source Code is available on [My Github](https://github.com/AmandaCameron/cc-glox) and pull requests are welcome!
